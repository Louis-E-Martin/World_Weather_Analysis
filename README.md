# World_Weather_Analysis

## Module 6
This is the location of my module 6 files where I first made a data base of over 200 cities with there location and weather peramiters, Then made a map of those citys found that fit into a certain criteria for traveling to, and lastly a Itenaray map traving between 4 diffent citys. This was all done using the Openweater API, and google maps APIs.
