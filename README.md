# World_Weather_Analysis

## Module 6
This is the location of my module 6 files. I first made a data base of over 700 cities with their location and weather parameters, then made a map and database of those citys in the orginal data base I made that fit into a certain criteria for traveling to, and lastly a Itenaray map traving between 4 diffent citys. This was all done using the Openweather API, and google maps APIs.
